My own implementation of: malloc, calloc, realloc and free in C - a college project. Works on Linux based systems as it is using a sbrk function to allocate raw memory (though a slightly different, custom sbrk).

Not my proudest work code-readability wise - quite unreadable and long functions, beware :)
